# Dependency Injection

[WORK IN PROGRESS]
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement [[Inversion of Control (IoC)]] for resolving dependencies and managing object lifetimes. It allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability.
